Our maze game is an 2d-animation game developed using android studio. The game consists of a ball and a board with a hole in the center of it. We are using accelerometer as controller to guide ball towards the hole. There are different types of screens in game called splash screen, signup screen, login screen…. User’s data will be stored in online database server which is based on php and MySQL.
